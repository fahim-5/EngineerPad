### 🔷 **What is a Class?**

A **class** is like a **blueprint**, a **template**, or a **recipe**. It defines **what something is** and **what it can do** — but it’s not the thing itself.

Think of it like a car factory mold — it describes **how to build** a car, not an actual car.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, color):
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

    def drive(self):
        print(f"The {self.color} {self.brand} is driving!")
```

Here’s what’s happening:

* `class Car:` → You're creating a class named `Car`.
* `__init__` → This is the constructor. It runs when an object is created from the class.
* `self` → Refers to the instance (the object) itself.
* `drive()` → A method (aka a function inside the class).

### 🟢 **What is an Object?**

An **object** is an **instance of a class**. It’s the **actual thing** built using the class blueprint.

You can build as many objects as you want from the same class:

```python
my_car = Car("Toyota", "red")
your_car = Car("Tesla", "black")

my_car.drive()   # Output: The red Toyota is driving!
your_car.drive() # Output: The black Tesla is driving!
```

Each object has:

* Its own **data** (brand, color).
* Its own **behavior** (the `drive()` method).

| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class      | TikTok filter template 🎨                                           |
| Object     | Each video using that filter 🎥                                     |
| `__init__` | The setup you do when using the filter (pick colors, vibes, etc) ⚙️ |
| Method     | What the video *does* — plays music, shows effects 🎬               |

### 🔁 TL;DR

* **Class = blueprint / idea / template**
* **Object = real-world instance of that idea**
* Python makes OOP super intuitive and aesthetic.
