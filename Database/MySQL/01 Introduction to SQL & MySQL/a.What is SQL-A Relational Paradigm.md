a. What is SQL – A Relational Paradigm

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). The “relational paradigm” refers to the data model behind these systems — a mathematical and logical framework based on relations (which you can think of as tables).

Key Concepts of the Relational Paradigm:

1. Data is Organized in Tables (Relations):

Each table is a relation, made up of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).

Example: A Users table with columns like id, name, email.



2. Each Row is Unique:

Every row represents a unique record.

Often enforced using primary keys.



3. Relationships Between Tables:

Tables can be linked using keys, especially foreign keys.

Enables data normalization, minimizing redundancy.



4. Declarative Query Language:

SQL lets you describe what data you want, not how to get it.

Example: SELECT name FROM Users WHERE age > 25;



5. Integrity Constraints:

Ensures data accuracy and consistency (e.g., primary key, foreign key, unique, not null).



6. Relational Algebra Foundation:

SQL operations are based on relational algebra: projection, selection, join, union, etc.

Why It's Important:

Scalability & Consistency: Crucial for enterprise systems with structured data.

Industry Standard: From legacy banking systems to modern SaaS platforms — SQL is everywhere.

ACID Properties: Ensures reliability through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

TL;DR

SQL + Relational Paradigm = A powerful, structured way to handle data that’s still dominating in corporate tech stacks — even in this NoSQL-heavy era.
