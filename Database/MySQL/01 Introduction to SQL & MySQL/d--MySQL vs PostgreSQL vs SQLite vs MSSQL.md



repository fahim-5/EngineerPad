## Use Case Comparison

### 1. **MySQL**
- **Best For:** Web applications, CMS platforms, SaaS products
- **Strengths:**
  - Fast read performance
  - Large community & ecosystem (e.g., LAMP stack)
  - Widely used in hosting environments
- **Limitations:**
  - Weaker support for advanced SQL features
  - Limited JSON and full-text search (compared to PostgreSQL)

---

### 2. **PostgreSQL**
- **Best For:** Complex applications, data warehousing, geospatial apps
- **Strengths:**
  - Advanced SQL compliance & extensibility
  - Rich data types (JSONB, arrays, hstore)
  - Native support for **PostGIS** (spatial data)
- **Limitations:**
  - Slightly higher learning curve
  - Heavier resource usage compared to MySQL

---

### 3. **SQLite**
- **Best For:** Mobile apps, small desktop apps, IoT devices
- **Strengths:**
  - Zero-config, serverless setup
  - Extremely lightweight (single `.db` file)
  - Great for prototyping and testing
- **Limitations:**
  - Limited concurrency (write operations are serialized)
  - Not ideal for high-volume or multi-user systems

---

### 4. **MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)**
- **Best For:** Enterprise applications, .NET stack, BI/Analytics
- **Strengths:**
  - Deep integration with Microsoft technologies (Azure, Power BI)
  - Robust tooling (SSMS, Profiler)
  - Strong security and support
- **Limitations:**
  - Expensive licensing (for full versions)
  - Less flexible for non-Windows platforms

## Conclusion

- **Choose MySQL** for performance-oriented web applications with broad hosting support.
- **Choose PostgreSQL** for enterprise-grade apps requiring complex queries, geospatial data, and extensibility.
- **Choose SQLite** for local storage, mobile or embedded devices, and small-scale projects.
- **Choose MSSQL** for enterprise systems using the Microsoft ecosystem or requiring advanced analytics and BI tools.
