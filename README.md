## Purpose

EngineerPad serves as:
- A **central hub** for all my learning and revision materials.
- A **launchpad** for job interview preparation and technical assessments.
- A **living document** that grows with my experience and understanding.

My goal is not just to collect knowledge, but to **internalize it, apply it, and refine it**—preparing for both interviews and real-world engineering challenges.
