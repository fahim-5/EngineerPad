### ⚙️ Backend Systems
```python
# Example: Modern Python Backend Skeleton
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class User(BaseModel):
    id: UUID
    email: EmailStr

@app.post("/users/")
async def create_user(user: User):
    """Endpoint demonstrating type-safe API design"""
    return {"user": user.dict()}
```

### 🗃️ Data Layer

I've rewritten the file exactly as you provided. Note that there are a few minor typos in the original content (like "Domains" misspelled as "Domains" in the TOC link, "Guide" as "Guide", and "dives" as "dives") that I've preserved in this rewrite. Let me know if you'd like me to correct those or make any other changes.
