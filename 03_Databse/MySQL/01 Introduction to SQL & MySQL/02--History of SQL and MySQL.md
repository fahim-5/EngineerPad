History of SQL (Structured Query Language)

1. Origin – 1970s:

SQL was born out of Edgar F. Codd’s relational model, proposed in a 1970 paper: “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.”

IBM researchers Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce developed a language called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) based on this model.

It was later renamed to SQL due to trademark issues.


2. SQL Becomes a Standard:

1986 – SQL became an ANSI standard.

1987 – Adopted as an ISO standard.

Over the years, SQL has evolved with new versions (SQL-89, SQL-92, SQL:1999, SQL:2003... up to SQL:2016+).


3. Purpose & Impact:

Designed to be a declarative language for querying and managing relational databases.

Became the lingua franca of relational DBMSs (Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).

History of MySQL

1. Origin – 1995:

MySQL was created by a Swedish company called MySQL AB, founded by Michael “Monty” Widenius, David Axmark, and Allan Larsson.

It was built to be a fast, open-source, and reliable RDBMS, initially using a storage engine called ISAM, later replaced by MyISAM and InnoDB.


2. Open Source Disruption:

MySQL became extremely popular among developers and startups due to:

Open-source licensing (GPL).

Lightweight footprint.

Speed and reliability for web applications.


Became a pillar of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python).


3. Acquisitions & Corporate Transitions:

2008 – MySQL AB was acquired by Sun Microsystems.

2010 – Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation, who now maintains MySQL.


4. Forks and Alternatives:

Concerns over Oracle’s control led to the creation of MariaDB (forked by Monty).

Today, MySQL is still widely used — powering platforms like WordPress, Facebook (initially), and many enterprise systems.

TL;DR:

SQL is the foundational language for relational databases, born in the 1970s at IBM.

MySQL is a popular open-source RDBMS that brought SQL to the web era starting in 1995.

Together, they changed how data is managed — from enterprise software to scalable cloud apps.
