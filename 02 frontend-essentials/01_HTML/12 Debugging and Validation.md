## 1. HTML Validators

**What is an HTML Validator?**

An HTML Validator checks your code against W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standards. It ensures your HTML is semantically correct and structurally sound.

**Why Use It?**

- Catches typos and syntax errors
- Improves browser compatibility
- Ensures accessibility
- Helps with SEO

**Popular Validator:**

- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Incorrect HTML -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page<title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome<h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph
  </body>
</html>

Validator Output:

Missing closing tags (</title>, </h1>, </p>)

Unclosed paragraph element


Fix:

<!-- Valid HTML -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>

2. Linting Tools

What is a Linter?

A linter is a static code analysis tool that detects errors, potential bugs, and coding style violations before you even run your code.

Why Lint?

Keeps your code clean and consistent

Prevents common bugs early

Makes collaboration smoother on teams


Popular Linting Tools:

Example (ESLint in JavaScript):

// Before linting
var foo = "Hello world"
console.log(foo)

Common issues:

Using var instead of let or const

Missing semicolons


After linting (fixed):

const foo = "Hello world";
console.log(foo);

How to Use ESLint (Quick Start):

npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init

<p>This is a paragraph

Fix:

<p>This is a paragraph</p>

b. Missing alt Attribute in <img> Tags

Mistake:

<img src="dog.jpg">

Fix:

<img src="dog.jpg" alt="A golden retriever playing in the park">

c. Improper Nesting of Elements

Mistake:

<a><p>Click here</p></a>

<a href="#"><span>Click here</span></a>

d. CSS Overuse or Conflicts

  color: blue;
}

Fix: Avoid overwriting styles unless intentional. Use specific selectors and consistent naming with BEM or other methodologies.
