## . Collaborating as a Team: Conflict Resolution

Merge conflicts are inevitable in team-based Git workflows — especially when multiple contributors are working on similar parts of a codebase. Mastering conflict resolution is not just about fixing code, but preserving the team’s flow and avoiding broken builds.

### Understanding Merge Conflicts in Team Environments

Conflicts happen when:
- Two developers change the same line in a file.
- One dev deletes a file that another dev modifies.
- Git cannot auto-merge due to diverging histories.

### Step-by-Step Conflict Resolution Flow

```bash
git pull origin main  # triggers conflict
git status            # shows files in conflict
git diff              # see what's conflicting
nano conflict-file.js # manually edit
git add conflict-file.js
git commit

## Final Thoughts

Git isn’t just a version control tool — it’s a developer’s journal, collaboration bridge, release engine, and history book. GitHub is its infinite library in the cloud.

Mastering Git & GitHub means mastering your **team workflow**, **deployment velocity**, and **open-source contribution power**.
