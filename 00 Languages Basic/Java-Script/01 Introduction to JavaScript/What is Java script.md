# JavaScript Overview

## What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. Over 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for dynamic behavior.

## Key Features

- **Interpreted & Lightweight**: JavaScript code is executed line-by-line, directly in the browser.
- **Client-Side & Server-Side**: Originally designed for client-side scripting, but now also widely used on the server side via platforms like **Node.js**.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables are not bound to a specific data type.
- **First-Class Functions**: Functions are treated as objects and can be passed as arguments.
- **Prototype-Based OOP**: Supports object-oriented programming using prototypes.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Built-in support for asynchronous behavior using **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await**.

## Common Use Cases

- Creating interactive UI components
- Validating form inputs in real-time
- Fetching data from servers via APIs (AJAX / Fetch)
- Building single-page applications (SPAs)
- Server-side logic using Node.js

## Example Code

```javascript
// A simple JavaScript function
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('Fahim');

```
