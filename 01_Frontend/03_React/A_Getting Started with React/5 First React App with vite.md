# Creating Your First React App with Vite

## Step 1: Install Node.js

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. Node.js includes npm (Node Package Manager) which we'll use to create our React app.

1. Download Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (LTS version recommended)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions
3. Verify installation by running these commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm if installed correctly.

## Step 2: Create a New Vite + React Project

With Node.js installed, create your React app using Vite:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
```

- Replace `my-react-app` with your preferred project name
- This command:
  - Creates a new folder with your project name
  - Sets up a React project using Vite
  - Configures the basic project structure

## Step 3: Navigate to the Project Folder

Move into your new project directory:

```bash
cd my-react-app
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command:
- Reads the `package.json` file
- Downloads all the necessary packages
- Creates a `node_modules` folder

## Step 5: Start the Development Server

Launch your development environment with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your React app will start and automatically open in your default browser at:
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Understanding the File Structure

Here's what your project contains:

```
my-react-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/              # Static files like favicon
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                 # Main source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css          # Main stylesheet
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx          # Main React component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.jsx         # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Root HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.js       # Vite-specific settings
```

### Key Files Explained:

1. **App.jsx** - Your main React component where you'll build your application
2. **main.jsx** - Renders the App component into the root DOM element
3. **vite.config.js** - Configuration file for Vite (no need to modify initially)

## Making Your First Changes

1. Open `src/App.jsx` in your code editor
2. Try changing the welcome message:
```jsx
<h1>Hello World! My First React App</h1>
```
3. Save the file and see changes instantly in your browser (Vite's Hot Module Replacement at work!)

## Next Steps After Setup

Now that your app is running, consider:

1. **Adding components**: Create new `.jsx` files in the `src` folder
2. **Styling**: Modify `App.css` or add new CSS files
3. **Managing state**: Learn about `useState` hook
4. **Adding routes**: Install React Router for multiple pages

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Port already in use**: Try a different port
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

2. **Missing dependencies**: Reinstall them
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully:

âœ… Created a React application with Vite  
âœ… Started the development server  
âœ… Viewed your app in the browser  
âœ… Made your first code change  

From here, you can begin building your React application by adding components, styles, and functionality.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
