# Your First "Hello World" App in Express.js

Creating a simple "Hello World" app is the best way to get started with Express.js. It helps you understand the basics of setting up a server, handling routes, and sending responses.

---

## Step 1: Project Setup

Before writing any code, make sure your environment is ready:

- Node.js and npm are installed
- You’ve created a project folder and initialized it using `npm init -y`
- Express.js is installed using `npm install express`

If that’s done, let’s move on.

## Step 2: Create the Application File

Create a file called `app.js` (or any name you prefer) inside your project folder.

Add the following code:

```javascript
// app.js

const express = require('express');      // Import the express module
const app = express();                   // Create an Express application

// Define a route for GET requests to the root URL
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');             // Send a response
});

// Start the server on port 3000
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000');
});


---

Step 3: Run the Application

Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

node app.js

If everything is set up correctly, you will see:

Server is running at http://localhost:3000

Now open a browser and visit:
http://localhost:3000

You should see:

Hello, World!

Explanation of the Code

const express = require('express'): Imports the Express framework.

const app = express(): Creates an Express application instance.

app.get('/', ...): Sets up a route for GET requests to the home page (/).

res.send('Hello, World!'): Sends a plain text response.

app.listen(3000, ...): Starts the server on port 3000 and logs a message when it's ready.



---

Summary

You’ve just built your first Express.js app that:

Starts a web server

Listens on port 3000

Sends "Hello, World!" when accessed at the root URL


This basic setup is the foundation for more complex Express apps where you’ll handle different routes, middleware, and business logic.
