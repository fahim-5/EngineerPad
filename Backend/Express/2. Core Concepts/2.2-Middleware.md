# Understanding Middleware Functions in Web Development

## What is Middleware?

Middleware functions are essential components in web frameworks like Express.js. They act as **interceptors** for requests and responses, allowing developers to perform specific operations **before the request reaches the final route handler** or **before the response is sent to the client**.

## How Middleware Works

When a client sends a request to a server, the request passes through a **stack of middleware functions**. Each middleware can:

- Inspect or modify the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects
- Execute any code
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware in the stack using `next()`

If a middleware does **not** call `next()`, the request will be **stuck**, and the response will not be sent.

## Example in Express.js

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request intercepted at:', new Date().toISOString());
  next(); // Pass control to the next handler
});

// Route handler
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
