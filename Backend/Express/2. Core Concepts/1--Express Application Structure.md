# Express Application Structure

When building scalable and maintainable web applications with Express.js, organizing your codebase properly is critical. A clean structure separates concerns, improves readability, and simplifies debugging and collaboration.

# Basic Express App Structure - Table Format

| Path              | Description                            |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `my-app/`         | Root directory of the project          |
| ├── `app.js`      | Main application entry point           |
| ├── `package.json`| Metadata and dependencies              |
| └── `node_modules/`| Installed npm packages and modules    |

## 3. Directory Roles Explained

### `/routes`
Handles application routing. Each file typically maps a group of endpoints.

```javascript
// routes/userRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const userController = require('../controllers/userController');

router.get('/profile', userController.getUserProfile);
module.exports = router;

/controllers

Contains the business logic. Controllers are called by route handlers.

// controllers/userController.js
exports.getUserProfile = (req, res) => {
  res.send('User profile data');
};

/models

Contains the database schema or model logic. Used with ORMs like Mongoose or Sequelize.

/middleware

Custom middleware like authentication, error handling, or logging.

/config

Centralized configuration for things like database connections, API keys, etc.

/public

Static files such as images, stylesheets, and client-side JS.

/views

Template files used for server-side rendering with view engines like EJS or Pug.

/utils

Generic utility functions (e.g., token generation, validation).

/logs

Logs captured using libraries like winston or morgan.

4. Sample app.js File Using the Structure

// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');

app.use(express.json());
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});

5. Benefits of a Structured Express App

Separation of Concerns: Routes, logic, data, and utilities are decoupled.

Scalability: Easily add new features or modules.

Maintainability: Easier to manage and debug code.

Collaboration: Multiple developers can work independently without conflicts.

Summary

A well-structured Express application lays the groundwork for scalability, clarity, and maintainability. As your app grows, modular organization becomes essential for long-term success and productivity.
