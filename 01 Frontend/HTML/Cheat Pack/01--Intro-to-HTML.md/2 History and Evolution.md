# History and Evolution of HTML (HTML1 to HTML5)

## HTML 1.0 (1993)
- **Developed by:** Tim Berners-Lee
- **Purpose:** Basic structure for web pages
- **Features:**
  - Very limited set of tags (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`)
  - No support for styling or layout
  - Primarily used for academic and scientific document sharing

## HTML 2.0 (1995)
- **Standardized by:** IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)
- **Enhancements:**
  - Form elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, etc.)
  - Tables (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`)
  - Improved semantics and usability
- **Limitations:** Still lacked scripting and multimedia support

## HTML 3.2 (1997)
- **Standardized by:** W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)
- **Key Improvements:**
  - Added support for scripting (JavaScript)
  - Support for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
  - Tables and font styling (`<font>`, `<center>`)
- **Drawback:** Blended structure with presentation (not cleanly separated)

## HTML 4.01 (1999)
- **Major Features:**
  - Clear separation of structure (HTML) and style (CSS)
  - Three versions: Strict, Transitional, Frameset
  - Better support for scripting and multimedia via external plugins
- **Limitations:** Still relied on plugins (e.g., Flash) for advanced features

## XHTML 1.0 (2000)
- **Extension of:** HTML 4.01 reformulated as XML
- **Benefits:**
  - Stricter syntax (well-formed documents)
  - Improved error handling
- **Downside:** Too rigid for widespread use

## HTML5 (2014 - Present)
- **Driven by:** W3C and WHATWG
- **Goals:**
  - Modernize HTML to support multimedia without plugins
  - Simplify doctype and syntax
- **Major Features:**
  - New semantic tags: `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`
  - Native audio and video support: `<audio>`, `<video>`
  - Form enhancements: `<date>`, `<email>`, `<range>`, `<search>`, etc.
  - Canvas API for drawing graphics: `<canvas>`
  - Web Storage, Geolocation API, Web Workers, WebSockets

## Conclusion
The evolution of HTML from version 1.0 to HTML5 represents the web's transformation from static pages to rich, interactive, multimedia-powered applications. HTML5 marks a major milestone in delivering native browser capabilities that align with modern user expectations across devices and platforms.
