# What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.  
It is the standard markup language used to create and design the **structure of web pages** on the internet.

## Key Points:

- HTML uses **elements** or **tags** (like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<div>`, etc.) to define content and layout.
- It is not a programming language â€” it is a **markup language**.
- HTML files usually have a `.html` extension and are rendered by web browsers.

## Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph in HTML.</p>
  </body>
</html>
