HTML: HyperText Markup Language

What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design documents that are displayed in a web browser. It structures the web content by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, multimedia, and other types of content.

HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language. It uses tags to describe the structure of web pages and is the foundation of all websites. Browsers read HTML files and render them into visual or audible web pages.
