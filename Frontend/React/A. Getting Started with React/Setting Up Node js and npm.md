Setting Up Node.js and npm

To start developing with React or any modern JavaScript tools, you first need to set up Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Here's how to do it:

1. Download and Install Node.js

a. Visit the Official Website

Go to https://nodejs.org

b. Choose a Version

LTS (Long-Term Support): Recommended for most users.

Current: Includes the latest features but may be less stable.


c. Run the Installer

Follow the installation wizard.

Ensure the option to install npm is selected.


2. Verify Installation

After installation, verify that Node.js and npm are correctly installed by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

node -v
npm -v

You should see version numbers displayed, confirming a successful installation.

3. Using a Package Manager (Optional)

If you prefer using a version manager for Node.js:

Windows: Use nvm-windows

macOS/Linux: Use nvm


This allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js easily.

4. Update npm (Optional)

To update npm to the latest version, run:

npm install -g npm

5. Create a Project Directory

Navigate to your desired directory and run:

mkdir my-app
cd my-app

6. Initialize a New npm Project

Run the following to create a package.json file:

npm init -y

This sets up the basic configuration for your project.

Conclusion

With Node.js and npm set up, you're ready to install frameworks like React and begin building modern web applications.
